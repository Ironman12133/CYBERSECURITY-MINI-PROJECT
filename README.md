# 🛡️ Beginner Cybersecurity Mini-Projects  
### 👨‍💻 Created by **Navneet Jaguri**

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly **cybersecurity mini-projects**!  
As someone diving into the world of cybersecurity, having explored **Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges and **TryHackMe** labs, I wanted to build something practical to solidify my knowledge.

Each folder in this repository contains a **standalone mini-project**, designed to help learn and demonstrate core cybersecurity concepts — from **cryptography** and **networking**, to **offensive/defensive tools**.

> 💡 Some projects are implemented in **multiple programming languages** for practice and deeper understanding.

## 🧭 Table of Contents

| 🧪 **Project Title**            | 📄 **Description** |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| 🔐 **RSA Algorithm**           | Built from scratch — the classic Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption method. |
| 🎹 **Keylogger**               | Logs and records all keystrokes on the system. A practical offensive tool. |
| 🌐 **Network Sniffer**         | Scans the local network, shows IP/MAC addresses of connected devices. |
| 🎣 **Phishing Pages**          | Mimics real websites to capture login credentials (for educational use only). |
| 🖼️ **Steganography (LSB)**     | Hides secret messages in image files using the `stegano` Python library. |
| 🔥 **SSTI (Flask)**            | Demonstrates Server-Side Template Injection leading to remote code execution. |
